asks for username
then the serialized username

calls auth() function -> verifies that username.length() > 5
ptrace call that we can overcome (breakpoint + 'set $eax=0')

after tumbling around the binary, we see that the cmp is at 0x08048866
serialized value is in $ebp-0x10
breakpoint there and print in decimal the actual serialized username created before in the function

abcdef -> 6232802

we get into a shell as level07
